There is a Network Manager object.
It contains references to each player's UI Box.
These references are then given to the Game Manager.

At game start, there is a menu with options, etc
Starting the game loads a lobby room where all the players stand around a table.
The host alone can interact with the menu, and all other clients see an alternate menu.
  -- client menu just shows number of players connected, their names, and their numbers
  -- clients also have a UI Box to change their name from the default.
  -- host menu allows for loading, configuring and saving of maps
  -- host menu also allows for complexity configuration
  -- host also has the UI box for changing their name
  -- host can kick players, and can also start the game
Once "Start" is clicked, the game manager runs SetupGame().
Each player then receives their UI Box.

The start player is chosen randomly. They are informed it is their turn via StartTurn(playernumber)
They can then perform their actions -- they are handled by calling out to the GameManager.
  (e.g. they broadcast where they're moving; they broadcast when they want a card; etc)
When they're done with their turn, they tell the GameManager -- who then continues by informing the next player, and so on.
